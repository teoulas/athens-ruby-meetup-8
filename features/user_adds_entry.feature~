Feature: User adds income and expense entries
  As I user
  I want to add income and expenses
  So that I can track my income and expenses

  Scenario: Add first income entry
    Given I have no entries
    When I visit the home page
    And I fill in "Entry" with "March Income 1000"
    And I click "Submit"
    Then I should see that I have "1" income line
    And I should see that I have "1000.00" total
